# NeuralCandy

The Neural Candy Dispenser combines image classifier and sugar highs in one delicious Android Things project.

The dispenser uses a Raspberry Pi to control both the image detection and the candy release. The application asks for an image (e.g. a cat or a dog) to be placed in front of the onboard Camera Module and the dispenser releases a delicious reward for you.
