# NeuralCandy

The Neural Candy Dispenser combines image classifier and sugar highs in one delicious Android Things project.

The dispenser uses a [Raspberry Pi 3 model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) to control both the image detection and the candy release. The application asks for a random animal image (e.g. a cat or a dog) to be placed in front of the onboard [camera module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) and the dispenser releases a delicious reward for you.
